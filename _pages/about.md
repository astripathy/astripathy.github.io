Prior to joining Missouri S&T, I was a postdoc with [Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). I received my Ph.D. from [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu) working with [Aditya Ramamoorthy](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

I am interested in identifying the fundamental hardness of, as well as designing new algorithms for, problems in machine learning. 
My solution methods typically combine perspectives from optimization, signal processing, and information theory. 
Some of my recent work has focused on learning from human feedback. Using sequential analysis techniques from multi-armed bandit literature, I have designed algorithms that are efficient in the amount of human feedback needed. Other work I have done is in obtaining appropriate representations of data that satisfy certain desired characterestics, such as invariance to a nuisance/sensitive attribute. Going forward, I would like to work on problems in transfer and in-context learning, reinforcement learning, and explainable AI.

Students with good mathematical background interested in pursuing a Ph.D. or M.S. thesis are encouraged to contact me via email.


I aim to develop a core undergraduate course titled _Principles of Machine Learning and AI_ over the next couple of years. With increasing interest among students and their potential employers in seeing if they have taken such a course, I believe it will be a solid addition to the Computer Science curriculum at Missouri S&T. 

I am a member of IEEE and ACM professional societies. I have been consistently asked to review articles in leading journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (_NeurIPS_), International Conference on Machine Learning (_ICML_), AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and others.

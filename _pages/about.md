Prior to joining Missouri S&T, I was a postdoc with [Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). I received my Ph.D. from [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu) working with [Aditya Ramamoorthy](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/adityar/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

I am interested in identifying the fundamental hardness of, as well as designing new algorithms for, problems in machine learning. 
My solution methods typically combine perspectives from optimization, signal processing, and information theory. 
Some of my recent work has focussed on learning from human feedback. Using sequential analysis techniques from multi-armed bandit literature, I have designed algorithms that are efficient in the amount of human feedback needed. Other work I have done is in obtaining appropriate representations of data that satisfy certain desired characterestics, such as invariance to a nuisance/sensitive attribute. Going forward, I would like to work on problems in reinforcement learning, multi-agent cooperative learning, and explainable AI. 

I aim to develop a core undergraduate course titled _Principles of Machine Learning and AI_ over the next couple of years. With increasing interest among students and their potential employers in seeing if they have taken such a course, I believe it will be a solid addition to the Computer Science curriculum at Missouri S&T. 

I am a member of IEEE and ACM professional societies. I have been consistently asked to review articles in leading journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (_NeurIPS_), International Conference on Machine Learning (_ICML_), AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and others. 
<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

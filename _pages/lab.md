The mission of the Statistical Machine Learning Lab is to obtain methods for autonomous systems that solve novel use-inspired research problems. Our focus is on using statistical techniques to theoretically analyze the performance of proposed methods and to quantify the hardness of the problem. We utilize algorithmic techniques to reduce their computational cost and make them feasible for real-world applications. Several problems we work on are of an interdisciplinary nature and involve collaboration both within and outside the Computer Science department. We provide a supportive and creative environment for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in current machine learning research.
